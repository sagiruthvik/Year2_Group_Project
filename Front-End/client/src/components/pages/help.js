                   <p> On the daily basis, Restaurants are forced to throw out tons of food all across the world.
                       We here at Meals on Wheels want to make a change to that - give purpose to all that food waste.
                   </p><br/>

                   <p>
                       Restaurants can now donate that excess food to people who are in need and Meals on Wheels is here for that. 
                        We want you to be able to not only help the environment but also those in need! 
                   </p><br/>

                   <p>
                    If you head over to the contact page and send us a message through the form and Meals on Wheels will be right back with you. 
                    We will help begin your community helping journey!
